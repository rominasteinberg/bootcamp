                <h3>History</h3>
                <div class="textColumns">
                    <p class="text-order">Doctor Stephen Vincent Strange is a powerful sorcerer and leading member of
                        the Masters of the Mystic Arts. He was a successful and arrogant neurosurgeon, until a car
                        accident severely damaged his
                        hands,causing him to set out on a journey that took him to Kamar-Taj, where upon discovering
                        magic and
                        alternate dimensions, he was disturbed by the Ancient One and Karl Mordo.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-order"> Though his focus was healing
                        his hands, Strange learned more about the mystical arts, and helped the Masters stop Kaecilius
                        and the Zealots from merging Earth with Dormammu's Dark Dimension, at the cost of the Old One's
                        death.
                        With the loss of his mentor, Strange became the protector of the New York Sanctuary and Earth
                        against
                        interdimensional threats.</p>

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <div class="textColumns">
                    <p class="text-order">Before he had his accident, Strange had a huge ego that fueled his career.
                        Strange agreed to only help patients who they believed would benefit their condition, even
                        refusing to operate on the
                        back of a United States Army colonel, although it was because this injury was simple enough for
                        any
                        neurosurgeon to operate on.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-order">His work also fueled his desire to control death and time, leading him to
                        refuse to even look at
                        any patients he perceived as having little chance of recovery so as not to ruin his record.
                        However,
                        if he also sensed the possibility of a patient surviving, it would help them recover even if it
                        didn't benefit his public image, showing that deep down, he cares about saving people.
